# Maze-Solving-Algorithmn-Visualiztion
The Maze Solver Algorithm Visualizer is a Python-based program that provides a graphical interface for visualizing the process of solving mazes using popular search algorithms such as A* and Dijkstra/BFS. This tool is designed to help users understand the inner workings of these algorithms by animating their step-by-step progress on a grid-based maze.

The project uses Python and Pygame to create an interactive grid interface where users can create custom mazes and observe the algorithm's real-time visualization. It aims to provide an educational and interactive way to learn about maze-solving algorithms.

#### Technologies used: ```Python, Pygame.```
